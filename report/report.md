The data set was imported into jupyter notebook and manipulated so that only rows that had a genre of hip hop or rap were shown. Matplotlib was then used to create a histogram of the column 'danceability'. This plot shows that all hip hop songs from 1921 to 2020 have a range of 0 to 1 but most hip hop songs fall between 0.6 and 0.9.
